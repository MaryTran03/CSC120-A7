Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the House subclass, I overloaded the constructor to set the default hasElecvator to FALSE, given the majority of houses on campus do not have an elevator. Furthermore, I adjust the argument type for the moveIn method to process an ArrayList to move in multiple residents. 

Similarly, in the Library subclass, I overloaded the constructor to set the default follors to 1 and adjust the argument type for the addTitle method to process an ArrayList to add multiple residents. 

Lastly, I overloaded the sellCoffee method and restock method for default sugar and cream portions. Most orders use a standard portion of 1 cream and 1 sugar, hence the need to overload the sellCoffee method. Similarly, since coffee sales on campus are predictable, there exists a standard way to restock the inventory.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
One thing that absolutely blew my mind was to finally understand how overloading helps set the default argument in the method. I realized that the orginal codes I had for restock() didnt make sense as I was also using default values. This assignment helped me build the feature I originally wanted to build by using overloaded methods.
